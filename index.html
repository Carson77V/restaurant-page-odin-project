        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>A bit of history. The founder Francesco Simali grew up in a small town in Spain.
          Spanish food was great, but pizza seduced Francesco away from typical Spanish Cuisine.
          After moving to New York in his teens, Francesco was given the opportunity to work on 
          his skills. In 2007 at the age of 32, he opened this restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>The food we make is filled with love and passion from out team. The team works hard 
          to make the best pizza in New York. Unlike many other pizza restaurants, we offer dine in 
          with some of the most comfortable furniture. We are proud of the design of our restaurant
          and we make our guests as comfortable as possible.
